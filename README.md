# Prework - CodePath PreWork

Submitted by: **Gunn Madan**

**CodePath PreWork** is an app that displays a simple user interface consisting of three labels and a button. Users interact by tapping the button, which triggers a dynamic change of the background color to a randomly generated color. This interactive functionality enhances the user's visual experience and provides a simple demonstration of event-driven programming in iOS.

### App Idea:
**StudyBuddy** is an innovative productivity app designed specifically for students. It combines features such as task management, personalized study timers (Pomodoro Technique), and a built-in peer accountability system. Students can organize tasks by class, set deadlines, and track progress visually. The app includes motivational notifications and allows students to connect with classmates for group accountability, creating shared study sessions and reminders to boost productivity and academic performance.

## Notes

One of the challenges encountered was connecting IBAction correctly due to mistakenly creating a referencing outlet instead of an action connection. After troubleshooting storyboard connections, the issue was resolved by removing the incorrect referencing outlet and properly reconnecting the button action.
